# A-Couple-of-Coders

Cinque Peggs and Ermaya Wise 

This website is for showcasing and reviewing my brother's clothing line. You will find clothing items such as shirts, pants, and jackets. My brother and I  defined a "Free King" as having the right or power to be free and having the ability to live your life with the controller. In conclusion, we came up with having the lion as our home page picture because lions are known as kings.

We wanted to add a review box where you can send us reviews on the contact page, but we ran out of time.

The website can work on the devices that correspond to the finished media queries in our code. We did not have time to make it responsive on all devices. 

If someone wanted to purchase an item they would have to contact us based off of the information on the contact page and let us know the item you want to purchase.

We tried really hard on this website, and we hope you enjoy it.
